# Welcome to Unity Design Patterns
### Examples of programming design patterns in Unity3D C# 

Thanks to [Robert Nystrom's Game Programming Patterns][1]
and the examples found on [Rivello Multimedia's website][2]. 
Each pattern is contained in a separate folder. Inside these are a folder ("structure") to show what classes are used in the pattern's structure and a folder ("example") showing a real-world example of using the pattern in Unity3D along with a scene showing it in action.

As these are accomplished I plan to do a blog article on each at [CleanSourceCode.com](http://cleansourcecode.com). Once the articles are done they will be referenced in each pattern's readme.md.

Details on each pattern can be found in the Readme.md file in each pattern's folder.

Patterns done:

 - [Command Pattern]
 - [Abstract Factory Pattern]
 - [Flyweight Pattern]
 - [Builder Pattern]
 - [Factory Method Pattern]
 - [Decorator Pattern]
 - [Strategy Pattern]

### Contributors Welcome
Please check out [contributors.md] if you'd like to help out with this project. It will take me forever to do all of these on my own and I'd love to have some help!
